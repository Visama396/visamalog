      My name is Víctor Sánchez Martínez but my friends call me visama. I started programming at 14. <strong>Since then I never stopped learning about technology.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have worked with start-ups like <strong>Biyectiva and their proyect "ConnecTVty"; Stampwallet, and Puntje</strong>. I later worked at Imaginanet developing new proyects and taking more responsabilities which made me improve greatly as developer.

      I love learning languages and travelling; reading books like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter; recently started playing the guitar.
