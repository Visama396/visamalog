                  I am a huge fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's works. 
                  I once read the One Ring poem in Japanese and after that wondered how it might look in other languages.
                  After that I tried searching other versions but there are a lot of different old websites, that either use images,
                  or have some languages that I can't even pronounce and they didn't add phonetics to help reading them.
                  So I wanted to make a more complete website with all kind of details.

          <article>
            <p>Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,</p>
            <p>Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,</p>
            <p>Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,</p>
            <p>One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne</p>
            <p>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</p>
            <p>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,</p>
            <p>One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them</p>
            <p>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</p>
