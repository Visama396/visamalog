                <p>This is a website I made to have the verse of the One Ring in as many languages as I could find.</p>
                <p>I guess there are already other people who had this idea, but since I couldn't find anything.</p>
                <p>I'll just post here the translations I know or I can find from the books in different versions.</p>
                <p>I hope you like it, and if you want to collaborate you can email me at: <span class="email">visama396 @ gmail.com</span></p>
